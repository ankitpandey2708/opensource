## Test Scenarios & Usernames

To verify the dashboard's versatility across different profile types, you can test the following usernames:

| Username | Profile Context & Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ankitpa` | **Minimalist**: A profile with no public repositories or pull requests. Tests the "Empty State" UI. |
| `13sushantsharma` | **Standard Contributor**: Has repositories but no public pull requests. Tests partial data rendering. |
| `ankitpandey2708` | **Active Developer**: Features repositories and pull requests, but lacks a "top-starred" repository highlight. |
| `praveentcom` | **High-Impact Profile**: Features both pull requests and high-performing repositories with significant stars. |
